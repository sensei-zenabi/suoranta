## [Time] Aristotle, 400BCE

Aristotle tied time to change and motion—“Time is the number of movement in respect of before and after.”
- Physics, Book IV

Motion defines time: Time doesn’t exist independently—it's a way to measure motion or change.

Relative and sequential: Time involves a "before" and "after"—a sequence of states, not a thing on its own.

No empty time: For Aristotle, if nothing changes, there’s no time.
